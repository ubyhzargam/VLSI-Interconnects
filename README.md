# VLSI-Interconnects
This repository has simulations of various models of Interconnects and the delay due to interconnects. All the simulations are done on LT Spice

RC MODEL - 

An RC interconnect has the following parameters:
Interconnect length / = 1000m
Resistance per unit-length R = 0.025/um
Capacitance per unit-length C = 0.5f F/um
Consider an input voltage clock of 2GHz, and peak voltage 1V, with 50% duty cycle.
(a) Simulate the output considering a single lumped RC model. Does the simulated 63% delay (the RC time constant) match with the theoretical value for the lumped model?
(b) Simulate the interconnect by dividing it in 5 sections to approximate the the distributed model.
(c) Simulate the interconnect by dividing it in 10 sections to approximate the the distributed model. Does the 63% delay converge to Elmore delay as you increase the number of sections?
(d) Simulate the interconnect with
(1) pi-equivalent model (ii) pi2-equivalent model
Does the equivalent i model give a better approximation of distributed model with lesser number of terms?
